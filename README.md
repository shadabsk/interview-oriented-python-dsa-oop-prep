# Interview-Oriented Python, DSA & OOP Preparation

This repository contains the complete codebase for my **Interview Preparation Series**, designed to help both beginners and experienced professionals strengthen their foundations and crack technical interviews with confidence.

The content here is based on **real interview questions** I faced across 45+ companies during my job-switch journey. Topics include Programming & Python Core, Advanced Python concepts, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Interview-Oriented Object-Oriented Programming with Python.

## 🚀 What This Repository Covers

### **1. Python Advanced Concepts**
Practical and interview-focused Python topics:
- Decorators (basic + parameterized)
- Generators
- Lambda, map, filter
- List comprehensions
- Zip and Pythonic shortcuts

---

### **2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

Real interview problems with:
- Intuition building  
- Variations of the same problem

Examples include:
- Sorting (Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Binary Search)
- Number manipulation problems  
- Combinatorics (K-sum, subset creation)
- String problems (reverse, palindrome, noisy, retaining chars)
- Dictionary problems (sorting, frequency mapping)
- Flattening structures
- Rotations  
- Stack problems  
- Parentheses validation  
- Bitonic sequence  
- Overlapping intervals  
- Spirally sorted matrix  
- Unique sequences and missing sequences

---

### **3. Interview-Oriented OOP with Python**

Topics included:
- Singleton pattern (basic + threadsafe)
- Class instance counter
- Method overloading
- Method overriding + Inheritance & MRO
- Operator overloading
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- SOLID Principles explained using Python
